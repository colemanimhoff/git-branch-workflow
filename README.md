# Git Workflow

## Objectives

- Explain the benefits of branch workflow
    1. So we aren't all commiting to the same branch
    2. ALlows teams to safely work on the same coebase at once
    3. Allows you to review, refine, debug code before commiting changes (specifically to master)
    4. Allows you to break up the work into smaller chunks and assign work easier
- Create branches
- Merge branches
- Resolve Merge Conflicts

* Feature Branching
* Task
* Release
